## Why choose OrangeUI?

OrangeUI is a rapid development javascript framework for soundly built web applications. It is meant as a tool to develop highly interactive, maintainable applications in the browser, giving the developer a pattern for organizing their interaction logic, views, and styles into a library of modular, decoupled components. OrangeUI provides the following:

- Object-oriented javascript objects
- Event mixin for objects
- HTML5 wrapper functions
- Module dependency management
- A real-time or RESTful data persistence layer w/offline mode
- Customizeable models
- Hierarchical ViewControllers with DOM helper functions
- View fragment loading w/ templating
- Live DOM model bindings
- History and route management
- Standardized UI controls

The goal of OrangeUI is to give you a customizable scaffold for building your web application that completely decouples your data sources from your controller logic and presentation and styling. OrangeUI sets up standards for how to organize your application code, standardize your styles and UI elements, and interact with web services. For a walkthrough of the basics, start by reading the [Getting Started] guide.
